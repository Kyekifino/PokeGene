# PokeGene
PokeGene v1.0

## What is PokeGene?
PokeGene is a small desktop application designed to use a [Genetic Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm) to create a population of unique, individual Pokemon, vying for surivival and dominance. Each of these Pokemon has their own set of statistics and typings, and by winning battles and breeding their traits into the population, can improve its standing in the group.

PokeGene uses the systems and mechanics from the core Pokemon game series, and will continue to add more of their mechanics to create a more fully fleshed-out mechanics. PokeGene does not, however, use the species found in the Pokemon game series, and through the use of an abstract Pokemon model, creates all new Pokemon species altogether. This model can be seen as a long-term Darwinian view of Pokemon evolution, with blocks representing full species rather than individual Pokemon.

## How can I use PokeGene?
PokeGene is built to run on the desktop, however being a Python application, it is necessary to use Python to open it. Make sure you have Python3 installed, and using Python3, run the PokeGene.py file. If you are missing any necessary libraries, an exception will be thrown, and you should use pip to install the library.
